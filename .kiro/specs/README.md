# Specs Directory

This directory contains feature specifications for the project. Each spec follows a structured approach:

## Spec Structure
Each feature spec should contain:
- `requirements.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format
- `design.md` - Technical design and architecture decisions
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist with actionable coding tasks

## Workflow
1. **Requirements** - Define what needs to be built with user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** - Create technical design based on requirements
3. **Tasks** - Break down design into actionable implementation steps

## Creating a New Spec
To create a new spec, use Kiro's spec workflow by describing your feature idea. The system will guide you through requirements gathering, design, and task planning.

## Executing Tasks
Once a spec is complete, you can execute individual tasks by opening the `tasks.md` file and clicking "Start task" next to specific items.
